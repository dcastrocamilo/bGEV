R code needed to reproduce the simulation studies and the data application in "Practical strategies for GEV-based regression models for extremes" by Daniela Castro-Camilo, Raphaël Huser ahd Håvard Rue. A tutorial for fitting the bGEV model with R-INLA can be found in www.r-inla.org/documentation. See also the following related articles:
